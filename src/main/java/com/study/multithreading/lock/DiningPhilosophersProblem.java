Implement the dining philosophers problem to demonstrate the problem of deadlock and synchronization in Java.
Five philosophers are sitting at a table, and each philosopher thinks and eats. They need two forks to eat.

Requirements:
     - Create five philosopher threads and a shared fork object.
     - Each philosopher must pick up the left and right forks to eat and release them afterward.
     - Handle synchronization of forks to prevent deadlocks.

Use `ReentrantLock` and `Condition` objects for more fine-grained control.
