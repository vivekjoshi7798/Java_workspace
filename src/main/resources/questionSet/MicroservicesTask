Write Code which will helps us to understand @Transactional  management in microservices using Spring Boot and JPA.
-try to understand declarative transaction management using @Transactional annotation.
-try to implement programmatic transaction management using TransactionTemplate.


Implement a Sprint boot application that demonstrates both declarative and programmatic way of handling propagation.


Implement a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the use of @Async annotation for asynchronous processing between two microservices, Service A and Service B.
-Service A should have an endpoint that triggers an asynchronous call to Service B.
-Service B should process the request and return a response to Service A.
-Use @Async annotation in Service A to handle the call to Service B asynchronously.
-Ensure proper configuration of Async support in Spring Boot application.
-Use RestTemplate or WebClient to make the call from Service A to Service B.
-Handle exceptions and timeouts appropriately in the asynchronous call.
-Write unit tests to verify the asynchronous behavior and correct response handling between the two services.
-Document the code with comments explaining the use of @Async and the flow of asynchronous processing between the two microservices.


Implement a custom interceptor in Spring Boot that logs the details of incoming HTTP requests and outgoing HTTP responses for a RESTful web service.
-The interceptor should log the HTTP method, URL, headers, and body of incoming requests.
-It should also log the status code, headers, and body of outgoing responses.
-Configure the interceptor to apply to all endpoints in the RESTful web service.
-Ensure that sensitive information (like passwords or tokens) is not logged.
-Write unit tests to verify that the interceptor correctly logs the required information.
-Document the code with comments explaining the functionality of the interceptor and how it is integrated into the
-same assignment try with annotation based approach as well as implementing HandlerInterceptor interface.



-create delete account api with soft delete functionality using Spring Boot and JPA.
-Implement an endpoint that allows users to delete their accounts.
-Instead of permanently deleting the user data from the database, implement soft delete functionality by adding a    "deleted" flag to the user entity.
-When a user requests account deletion, set the "deleted" flag to true instead of removing the record from the database.
-Ensure that all queries for user data exclude records where the "deleted" flag is set to true.
-Write unit tests to verify that the soft delete functionality works as expected.
-Document the code with comments explaining the soft delete implementation and its benefits.
