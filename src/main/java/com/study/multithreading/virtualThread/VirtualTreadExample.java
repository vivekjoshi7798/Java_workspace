/*
*Goal: Understand how a virtual thread is created and scheduled.

Requirements:
Create 100,000 virtual threads
Each thread should:
    Print its thread name
    Sleep for 1 second

Ensure the program completes cleanly

Hints:

Use Thread.ofVirtual().start(...)

Compare thread names with platform threads

/*
* What’s Actually Happening
1️⃣ Thread.ofVirtual()
Creates a virtual thread builder

2️⃣ .start(...)
Creates and starts the virtual thread immediately
No need to call run() yourself (that would run on main thread ❌)

3️⃣ Thread.sleep(2000)

Virtual thread is unmounted from its carrier thread
Carrier thread is free to run other virtual threads
After 2 seconds, scheduler remounts it
